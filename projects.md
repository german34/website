# Projects

## Leveraging Artificial Neural Networks for Neuronal Signal Recovery 
- Developed and evaluated foundational artificial neural networks to recover temporal signals from synthetically generated calcium images, leveraging both dense and convolutional architectures.
- Explored image preprocessing and data manipulation techniques for feature extraction and normalization
- Experimented with various hyperparameters, including learning rates, epochs, architecture depth, and loss functions, to optimize model performance and enhance signal recovery.




## Machine Learning Toolkit

- Implemented fundamental machine learning techniques, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) decomposition, gradient descent, backtracking step-size adjustment, and Generalized/K-fold cross-validation, to build a robust toolkit for model evaluation and optimization.
- Utilized RStudio packages, including dplyr, devtools, roxygen2, ggplot2, and caret, to develop and validate testing files for verifying each functionality.
